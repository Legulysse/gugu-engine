# Console Commands

## Overview

Console commands are available at runtime by using the Â² key.  
A prompt will appear at the top of the window, where you can enter the desired command and its arguments.  

The engine provide several built-in commands, but other commands can be implemented in the Application. Any command entered in the console will be forwarded to the application for custom computations.
